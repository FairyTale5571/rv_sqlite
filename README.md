# RV_SqLite
## Simple SQLite wrapper for Arma

Quite recently, I started learning the C ++ language and as a coincidence, my little module needed a database.

Having poured my small, young, ambitious mind, my choice fell on SQLite3, but I faced a number of problems, due to my little knowledge of the C ++ language, therefore, decided to develop publicly, you never know, someone will throw me a pull request and I will acquire mega-knowledge, mega-brain, and then they will take me to work in the BIS (or somewhere else).


### What's done now?
- Opening a database
- executing any query to it.

## What are you planning to do?
- Opening several databases and working with them.
- Database encryption.
- And maybe you will have some other ideas that I most likely cannot do now (Why? I don't have enough mind.).

## What needs to be done right now to make it work fully(????)
- ï»¿ Returning the result and creating a database next to the dll, now it is created next to the game exe (Yes, I don't know how to determine the path to the library, kick me)

### If you have any suggestions for development, please write, I will be happy to help in any way I can!
